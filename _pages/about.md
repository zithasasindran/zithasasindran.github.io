I completed my Ph.D. from Department of Electronic Systems Engineering at Indian Institue of Science (IISc), Bangalore.
I am broadly interested in Machine Learning Systems for real-world applications. My current research focus is on Federated Learning, Generative AI and Business. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
