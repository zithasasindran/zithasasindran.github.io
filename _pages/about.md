I am a researcher with a Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, where I spent my time figuring out how to make machine learning work on resource-limited devices like IoT gadgets and mobile phones. Basically, I am all about building smart, scalable systems that actually work in the real world.

My research covers a mix of federated learning, and  automatic speech recognition, with a recent obsession with weaving generative AI into these fields. Whether it’s designing on-device learning systems for speech recognition or coming up with new ways to evaluate ASR systems, I love solving complex problems, especially in resource-constrained environments.

I have led cool projects like the Boeing speech-to-text initiative and worked on tech that improves accessibility and the overall user experience. Besides research, I am all about collaboration, mentorship, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

If you’ve got a fun project or want to chat, I am always open to new ideas—feel free to reach out!
